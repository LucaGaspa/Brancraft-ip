Easy Telegram bot to spot your public ip address

Dynamic public ip addresses can create connection issues when you have to host servers for your friends. Okay, static ip addresses can be assigned to private citizens, but a Telegram bot seems a valid alternative when you have to look cool to your friends. Just write a message to the bot and connect to my awsome minecraft server.
